Recitation class lecture notes for VE280

# Build

LaTeX package `minted` is used to highlight the code in this project. 

In order to make it work, you should add `-shell-escape` option to your latex compiler, and install the python package `Pygments` if you are to build
this directly.

Alternatively with the dependencies install simply `make` and you should find a built copy under `build/`. 

A copy of the built pdf is committed into the repo so people can read without cloning. The content is outdated, and frankly somewhat unpolished with the benefit of the hindsight but I think this should be left in for the sake of maintaining an honest history.

As you already know there are unfished chapters and things tends to get much worse towards the last chapters.
